				<h1>The Orange Leaf Story</h1>
				
			</div>	
		</div>	

		<p>Orange Leaf was originally founded as Orange Tree Frozen Yogurt in 2008 in Oklahoma. Mike Liddell purchased the company in 2010 and moved it from Oklahoma to California. He changed the name to Orange Leaf and hired Reese Travis as the CEO. The company has since then expanded into roughly 225 stores throughout the country.</p>

		<p>This community friendly frozen yogurt store is most comonly known for their self-serve options and choose-your-own-toppings. They offer a multitude of flavors along with sugar free and lactose free choices.</p>

		<p>They strongly believe in making their customers feel comfortable and at home in all store locations and encourage uniqueness and originality. Hence the "create your own" theme displayed in their store.</p>
